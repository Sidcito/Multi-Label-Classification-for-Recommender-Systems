This was an attempt to show the construction of a recommendation system which functions on the basis of a multi-label classification.

Using a classifc Random Forest Classifier, chained one after the other, allows room for the consideration of relationships 
between each of the 4 products (Assurance Vie, Credit Immobilier, Livret A and PEA)

One assumption made here is that each client can have only one of each product.
